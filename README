README for the velinux-archive-keyring package
=============================================

Introduction
------------

The veLinux project signs its Release files that are stored on the
veLinux ftp-server and its mirrors with the keys contained in this
packages.

A quick overview about this package:

* Each actively used key is placed in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ to
  be used by "apt" and its apt-key command in versions 0.6 and later.
  The signatures of acquired Release files is checked against this
  key database. It hence contains all keys of releases that are still
  supported and need to be active.
* /usr/share/keyrings/velinux-archive-keyring.gpg:
  A keyring including all actively used keys to sign Release files in
  our supported releases is shipped in /usr/share/keyrings.

More information about the archive authentication feature can be found
in the manpage apt-secure(8).
